# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository contains my journey through various DSA concepts and problems, aimed at honing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm **Robin K Philip**! I'm a self-taught developer and a passionate Machine Learning Engineer. I enjoy solving problems with cutting-edge technologies and have a keen interest in web technologies and scalable distributed systems. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously learning new methodologies to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Arrays and Strings:** Problems and solutions related to arrays and string manipulation.
- **Linked Lists:** Implementation and problems involving singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Classic stack and queue problems along with their implementations.
- **Trees and Graphs:** Traversal algorithms, shortest path problems, and more.
- **Sorting and Searching:** Implementation of common sorting algorithms and search techniques.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Detailed implementations of graph data structures (like adjacency lists), fundamental traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), and solutions to common graph-based LeetCode problems. (See `9.Graph/README.md`)
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A focused look at Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, including its implementation and application to relevant LeetCode problems. (See `10.DijkstraAlgorithm/README.md`)
- **Dynamic Programming:** Problems that can be solved using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Miscellaneous:** Other important problems and concepts that don't fit into the above categories.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions as a reference for your own learning. Each folder contains:

- **Problem Statements:** A description of the problem and its constraints.
- **Solution Implementations:** My approach to solving the problem, including code and comments for better understanding.
- **Test Cases:** Sample inputs and outputs to test the solution's correctness.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-practice-code.git
2. **Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```bash
    cd dsa-practice/arrays-and-strings
3. **Run the solutions:
Open the solution file in your preferred code editor and run the code to see the output.
